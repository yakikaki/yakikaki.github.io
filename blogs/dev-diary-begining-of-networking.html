                <p>Multiplayer games is the new modern meta, and i've been focusing on mainly local singleplayer video games, so i thought to myself why not try multiplayer? oh boy what i've gotten myself into</p>

                <h2>Beggining of the project</h2>
                <p>i actually started this project on an old one i've stopped working on long ago, so i had a baseplate, but man it just caused me issues<br>
                since i haven't touched this project for like a year i forgot how it was structured so i had to read every file and figure how it all works all over again, that took me almost an entire day..<br>
                this project i pulled from my documents folder was a 2D platformer i created to learn openGL and practice GUI optimization for multiple platforms<br>
                once i figured the structure i had to start figuring how i will implement a client connection to a server.<br>
                but first you gotta have a server right?</p>
                <h2>Creating the server</h2>
                <p>The library i picked for this networking project was <a href="http://enet.bespin.org">ENet</a>, setting up a server with it wasn't really difficult, considering the very limited documentations</p>
                <img>an image will be here
                <p>Viola! the server is up and running locally, the next step would be connecting to the server through a client, sounds easy right?</p>
                <p>Well yeah setting up a client connection was easy, i even built a cool menu to debug server stuff in</p>
                <img>another image will be here
                <p>But when i thought everything was going smoothly, something had to go wrong!!!</p>
