                <p>Multiplayer games is the new modern meta, and i've been focusing on mainly local singleplayer video games, so i thought to myself why not try multiplayer? oh boy what i've gotten myself into</p>

                <h2>Begining of the project</h2>
                <p>i actually started this project on an old one i've stopped working on long ago, so i had a baseplate, but man it just caused me issues<br>
                since i haven't touched this project for like a year i forgot how it was structured so i had to read every file and figure how it all works all over again, that took me almost an entire day..<br>
                this project i pulled from my documents folder was a 2D platformer i created to learn openGL and practice GUI optimization for multiple platforms<br>
                once i figured the structure i had to start figuring how i will implement a client connection to a server.<br>
                but first you gotta have a server right?</p>
                <h2>Creating the server</h2>
                <p>The library i picked for this networking project was <a href="http://enet.bespin.org">ENet</a>, setting up a server with it wasn't really difficult, considering the very limited documentations</p>
                <img src="/assets/server-blog-img2.png">
                <p>Viola! the server is up and running locally, the next step would be connecting to the server through a client, sounds easy right?</p>
                <p>Well yeah setting up a client connection was easy, i even built a cool menu to debug server stuff in</p>
                <img src="/assets/server-blog-img1.png">
                <p>But when i thought everything was going smoothly, something had to go wrong!!!</p>
                <h2>Clients, ghosts, and other spooky stuff</h2>
                <p>So at this point i was sure i was about to finish the base of the network manager (never think you're about to be done), but this is where i encountered the weirdest
                    issue i've seen.<br>
                    the client connected alright, well at least that's what it said as you can see down here
                </p>
                <img src="/assets/server-blog-img3.png">
                <p>but the server didnt react to the connection... no matter what way i tried to establish the server, or the connection the server acted as if a ghost joined!</p>
                <p>(also yeah i skipped the part where i port forwarded the server to my domain)</p>
